random scripts for my own use case.  
adquery.rb is a WIP havent added routes, and its basic AD querying at this point.
lita-ssh lets you use an ssh key and a username to execute scripts against local linux systems
mq.rb is a WIP rabbitMQ status that takes the name of an MQ server to return information
tweet.rb is a script that lets you ask your lita bot to post a tweet for you.

I offer no support on these.
